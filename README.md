# DSPproject

### Introduction
In this project, we successfully implemented three vocoder effects, namely Robotization, Whisprization, and Pitch Shifting, using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Inverse STFT (ISTFT). These effects were designed specifically for real-time voice processing and can be accessed through a user-friendly Tkinter GUI.


### Execute
Clone this repository and ensure all files are in the same folder. Run DSP_project_main.py to launch the GUI and try the audio effects.
